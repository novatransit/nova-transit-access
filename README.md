# nova-transit-access

As part of our NoVA Transit Dashboard refresh, the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission (NVTC) sought to redefine our access to transit and access to jobs methodology used in the dashboard. This repository contains the data sources, analysis parameters, and code used to conduct access to opportunity analysis for Northern Virginia transit systems.

## Dashboard

***[The dashboard is available here.](/)***

## Directory

This repository is broken down into several subfolders:

* **[documentation](/documentation/)** - Detailed methodology documentation covering data sources and analysis parameters used in the access to opportunity analysis
* **[data](/data/)** - Sample datasets used in the analysis
* **[scripts](/scripts/)** - Analysis code and processing scripts
* **[sample-outputs](/sample-outputs/)** - Example outputs and visualizations from the analysis
